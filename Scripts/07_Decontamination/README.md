# 7. Decontamination

To ensure our dataset is free from contaminant sequences, we performed a decontamination step using [MMseqs2](https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2), a high-performance sequence search and clustering tool.

## MMseqs2

[MMseqs2](https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2) (Many-against-Many sequence searching) is a fast and efficient alternative to BLAST, offering speed improvements ranging from 100x to 10,000x. Given that our decontamination step involves comparing against large datasets (RefSeq Archaeal, Bacterial, Fungal, Viral, Plastid, etc.), MMseqs2 provides the performance necessary without significantly sacrificing sensitivity.

We recommend installing MMseqs2 directly from the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2).

### Decontamination Database

On **11 July 2023**, we compiled a comprehensive decontamination database that includes:

- **Negative control set (RefSeq)**: Bacteria, Archaea, Fungi, Viruses, Plastid, Plasmid, Protozoa, Mitochondrial, and Invertebrate genomes
- **Positive control set**: *Zygnematophyceae* (strain SAG 110.80Mneu, as this is the only axenic strain and no reference genome exists at this time)

To simplify header parsing during classification, we reformatted all FASTA headers using the script [`simplify_headers_for_blastdb.py`](https://github.com/mjbieren/Phylogenomics_klebsormidiophyceae/blob/main/Scripts/07_Decontamination/simplify_headers_for_blastdb.py), developed by Dr. Iker Irrisari:

```bash
python simplify_headers_for_blastdb.py [inputFile] [RenameHeaders] >> [FileOutput]

```
Where the FileOutput is the concatenated file for all sub-databases (e.g., RefSeq Bacteria, RefSeq Archeae, etc).
I used the following combinations:
```
"arch_neg" for the Archea set
"bact_neg" for the Bacteria set
"virus_neg" for the Viridae set
"fungi_neg" for the Fungi set
"invert_neg" for the Invertebrate set
"plast_neg" for the Plastid set
"plasm_neg" for the Plasmid set
"mito_neg" for the Mitochondrion set
"proto_neg" for the Protozoa set
"zygn_pos" for the Zygnematophyceae positive set (SAG 110.80Mneu in this case as we don't have a reference genome and this is the only axenic strain)
```
These tags are critical for identifying contaminants in later classification steps. Ensure all identifiers are consistent and free of whitespace.

### Preparing the Decontamination Database
To convert the formatted FASTA file into an MMseqs2-compatible database, run:
```
mmseqs createdb Decontamination_Zygn_DB.fa Decontamination_Zygn_DB.db
mmseqs createindex Decontamination_Zygn_DB.db tmp
```
This prepares the decontamination database for alignment and filtering.

### Converting the Protein File.
Next, convert your protein sequences (e.g., from TransDecoder) into an MMseqs2 database:
```
mmseqs createdb StrainName_genes_supertranscript.fasta.transdecoder.pep StrainName_db.db || module purge && exit -1
mmseqs createindex StrainName_db.db tmp || module purge && exit -1
```
Alternatively, you can use the provided script ConvertToMMseqsDatabase.sh in the same directory as your .pep file.


### Running the script
Now simply run the script [Decontamination_MMSEQS_Memmode.sh](https://github.com/mjbieren/Phylogenomics_klebsormidiophyceae/blob/main/Scripts/07_Decontamination/Decontamination_MMSEQS_Memmode.sh)
Don't forget to change the variables on lines: 8,9,10,11.

The output will be a simple outfmt6 output, identical to a blast output file with outfmt6 format.

## Get Positive Data Set (GPDS)

After running the MMseqs2 decontamination step, we extract only the positively matched protein sequences (i.e., non-contaminants) using the [GPDS](https://github.com/mjbieren/GPDS/) tool.

`GPDS` filters sequences based on MMseqs2 output and a defined positive reference tag (e.g., `zygn_pos`). This allows us to retain only sequences that match our target lineage (e.g., *Zygnematophyceae*), discarding all identified contaminants.

---

### Run GPDS

To run [GPDS](https://github.com/mjbieren/GPDS/), use the following command:

```
GPDS.out -i <HeaderFile> -f <Fasta> -b <MMSeq2Output> -c <EvalueColumn> -s <StrainName> -r <OutputPath>
```
### Parameters

- `-i` — Header file that maps sequence identifiers to labels  
  ➤ Example: [`Headerfile_zygn.txt`](https://github.com/mjbieren/Zygnematophyceae_Phylogenomics/blob/main/Scripts/07_Decontamination/Headerfile_zygn.txt)

- `-f` — Protein FASTA file output from TransDecoder  
  ➤ Example: `StrainName_genes_supertranscript.fasta.transdecoder.pep`

- `-b` — MMseqs2 output file in `outfmt6` format  
  ➤ This file is generated from the MMseqs2 decontamination search.

- `-c` — E-value column index  
  ➤ For `outfmt6`, the E-value is typically in column `11`.

- `-s` — Strain name (used as output prefix)

- `-r` — Output directory where the filtered FASTA file will be saved

### Optional: Batch Processing

Suppose you have followed all previous steps and now want to process multiple samples at once. In that case, you can consolidate all `TransDecoder .pep` files into a single directory and run the following script to perform decontamination across the dataset:

[07_DecontaminationWholeSet.sh](https://github.com/mjbieren/Zygnematophyceae_Phylogenomics/blob/main/Scripts/07_Decontamination/07_DecontaminationWholeSet.sh)
